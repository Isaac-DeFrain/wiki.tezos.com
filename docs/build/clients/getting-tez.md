## Getting tez

In order to get Tez tokens to use when testing your application on testnet, you need to use a faucet. Test networks have a list of built-in accounts with some funds. You can obtain the key to these accounts from a faucet to claim the funds. 

All networks share the same faucet: [https://faucet.tzalpha.net/](https://faucet.tzalpha.net/)
